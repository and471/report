\section{Project Introduction}
As part of the renovation of the William Penney Building on the Sherfield 
walkway, interactive screens are to be installed. Mounted inside the building, four projectors will simultaneously display content onto floor to ceiling glass
panels that are visible to passers-by. Also, an 84-inch 4K resolution touch 
screen is to be mounted by the entrance doors. 

Our project consists of developing an ``App Store" for uploading interactive content and visualisations to be displayed on the four projected screens. Administrators will also be able to use this system to moderate and schedule content. Finally, we will be developing a playout system to show the content on multiple screens in multiple resolutions.
